        "answer": "a lot of people are alone right now but we dont have to be lonely were all in this together while you may be physically separated from friends family members and other loved ones it has never been more important to maintain those social connections social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support talk through difficult feelings share a laugh keep up-to-date with loved ones and help each other cope this pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own while measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you for example you might prefer a video chat over a phone call or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call then work with your social networks to make a plan you might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week remember to be mindful of people who may not be online check in by phone and ask how you can help the quality of your social connections matter mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesnt build strong social connections make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected if your current strategies dont help you feel connected problem-solve to see if you can find a solution everyone feels lonely at times—maybe you recently moved to a new city are changing your circle of friends lost someone important in your life or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs arent met measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now reach out to the connections you do have suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect people may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons so dont be afraid to be the one who asks look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media this pandemic is bringing everyone together so look for opportunities to make new connections these groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support look for specialized support groups support groups are moving online and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone to find community services in bc call or text or visit wwwbcca if you need extra support you can talk with a psychologist or counsellor for free you can access a free phone call with a registered psychologist though the covid- psychological support service from the bc psychological association visit wwwpsychologistsbccacovid--resources you can access free phone-based short-term support with a counsellor from a new group called the bc covid- mental health network email bccovidtherapistsgmailcom to receive an appointment time for youth people ages - you can talk with a counsellor for free through foundry virtual visit foundrybccaget-supportvirtual call the bc mental health support line at - its available chat online with a crisis center volunteer at wwwcrisiscentrechatca daily between noon and am for older adults call the seniors distress line at -- for youth and young adults chat online with a volunteer at wwwyouthinbccom daily between noon and am for children and youth call the kids help phone at --- or visit kidshelpphoneca for tips on managing loneliness check out the following resources coping with loneliness from the canadian mental health association cmhabccadocumentscoping-with-loneliness loneliness and social connection issue of visions journal at wwwheretohelpbccavisionsloneliness-and-social-connection-vol wellness module social support at wwwheretohelpbccawellness-modulewellness-module--social-support",

        "answer": "distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated if you dont have a lot of energy or focus right now try low-effort distractions like watching tv browsing youtube listening to a podcast or audiobook playing a game on your phone reading an easy book or magazine or working on a simple art project if you have more energy and focus give yourself a to-do list every day you can clean and take care of projects around your home work on hobbies connect with family or friends read a new book and catch up on your favourite tv shows you can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through moocs and other online learning platforms you can learn a new language online or through apps and you can learn new hobbies and activities as more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes you can tour museums and art galleries skype with a scientist watch animals at zoos and nature preserves and more when normal schedules are disrupted its easy to fall into unhelpful habits look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits you could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family—whoever takes the most language classes wins! many communities are using social media platforms like facebook to organize support and help for neighbours if you are healthy and its safe to do so you can sign up to walk dogs pick up groceries and household supplies and help others who cant go out at the moment this can be a great way to make new connections in your area and helping others is good for your own mental health just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing—your own health is important",

        "answer": "how you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours when we feel stressed out angry or fearful its hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have remember we all control our own actions and reactions no matter whats going on in the world we can call do something about this pandemic people often overestimate the negative parts—their own feelings their own abilities to manage a difficult situation or the situation itself—and underestimate positive parts—their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones their support networks and opportunities how does the thought were never going to make it through this! make you feel it likely doesnt feel good—and it isnt even true challenging negative unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood validate your ability to get through this and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well stop and notice thoughts that come up how do they make you feel do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively how can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation here are a few example im so mad that my event was cancelled! this sucks! i know this is the safer option for everyone when its rescheduled ill enjoy it more because i wont have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness i hate spending so much time at home this is so boring im doing my part to keep my neighbours safe its worth it because it keeps people healthy im having a hard time getting used to my new schedule this is so frustrating ill get used to this soon just like i adapted the last time i had to change my schedule now that im home more ill have more time to finish the projects i havent touched in months and im excited to see the end results im really scared and i dont know what to do i feel so overwhelmed right now it makes sense that i feel scared—people are getting sick and we dont know when things will go back to normal but there are a lot of things i can do to keep healthy and im going to do some research so i can do my best when i focus on the things i can do everything feels more manageable were going to be stuck inside forever im already sick of this i understand that it will take some time to manage covid- and i trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can i know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal the goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that theres a problem instead this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now",

        "question": "how can i challenge thinking traps",
        "answer": "what you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects—this is normal and expected however when you interpret situations too negatively you might feel worse youre also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term these automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time youre most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad angry anxious depressed or stressed youre also more vulnerable to thinking traps when youre not taking good care of yourself like when youre not eating or sleeping well here are some common thinking traps thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen people who overgeneralize often use words like always or never i was really looking forward to that concert and now its cancelled this always happens to me! i never get to do fun things! seeing things as only right or wrong good or bad perfect or terrible people who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure i wanted to eat healthier but i ate too many snacks today this plan is a total failure! saying only negative things about yourself or other people i made a mistake im stupid! my boss told me that i made a mistake my boss is a total jerk! predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence ive been doing what i can to stay home and reduce the risks but i just know that im going to get sick focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive i know theres a lot i can do at home but im just so sick of this everything is terrible believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation i feel scared and overwhelmed right now so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better telling yourself how you should or must act i should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills you can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at wwwheretohelpbcca dont try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way this doesnt let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap when you try and push upsetting thoughts away they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens what is the situation what actually happened only include facts that everyone would agree on what are your thoughts what are you telling yourself what are your emotions how do you feel what are your behaviours how are you reacting what are you doing to cope take a look at the thoughts youve listed are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns its common to fall into more than one thinking trap go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation the best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts use the evidence youve collected to challenge your thinking traps here are some ways to do that try to find evidence against the thought if you make a mistake at work you might automatically think i cant do anything right! i must be a terrible employee! when this thought comes up you might challenge it by asking is there any evidence to support this thought is there any evidence to disprove this thought you might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently which doesnt support the idea that youre a bad employee ask yourself would i judge other people if they did the same thing am i being harder on myself than i am on other people this is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts for example you might have trouble with one of your kids and think good parents wouldnt have this kind of problem to challenge this thought you can ask other parents if theyve ever had any problems with their kids test your beliefs in person for example if you think that your friends dont care about you call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call if you assumed that they will all say no you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you once you have worked through some challenges try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps lets use the following example i feel sad and overwhelmed im having a hard time figuring out what to do im the worst! i should be able to handle this! labeling should statements examine the evidence i have a lot of challenges right now im worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly ive successfully handled complicated situations in the past so i know i can do this its okay to feel upset right now—theres a lot going on im going to think about how i got through past situations and see what worked for me im trying to do a lot on my own so im going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together try the healthy thinking worksheet at wwwheretohelpbcca check out anxiety canadas articles helpful thinking and thinking traps this page is adapted from wellness module healthy thinking at wwwheretohelpbccawellness-modulewellness-module--healthy-thinking",

respect your loved ones boundaries and let them tell you when theyre ready to talk symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations sensations that arent real like hearing voices or delusions beliefs that cant be true like believing that you are being followed by a spy can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan as a group these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis many people have a hard time responding to a loved ones hallucinations or delusions its best to avoid arguing about these experiences remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophrenia—they are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of telling someone that their experiences arent real or arent true doesnt help when the experiences feel very real to that person! a better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring up—without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion for example if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices it isnt helpful to say something like “youre okay! it isnt real i dont hear anything” instead you might say “i can only image how upsetting that voice must be i can see the voice makes you feel scared” know that with good treatment and support symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance ask how you can help when people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again especially if they have dependent children these plans such as advanced directives or ulysses agreements are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help if youd like to learn more about planning for care see the bc schizophrenia society if a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis they might need extra help for example people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact when people are recovering from an episode of psychosis they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly while other times it may take a lot of time and effort to get back into routines keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive it may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved ones tasks or chores yourself but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities and let them tell you when they need extra help schizophrenia can be a difficult illness—for everyone during episodes of psychosis your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you cant understand they may act in ways that you dont understand other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings communicate clearly or seem interested in others its important to know that these are symptoms of an illness they are no ones fault but they can still be hard to cope with consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support the bc schizophrenia society has a directory of groups around bc at wwwbcssorgmonthly-meetings-calendar as a family member its important to take care of yourself try to maintain your regular schedule and activities such as your exercise routine and hobbies ask another family member or good friend to provide help with caregiving especially in the early days of your loved ones illness if you need help balancing time for self-care with caregiving duties check out the bc schizophrenia societys family respite program try to maintain your friendships or the network of people that you have in your life these will later become important supports as your loved one recovers educate them and update them on your loved ones recovery people are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease this is very important!

        "answer": "people tend to use the word “addiction” to mean very different things “i am addicted to shopping” might mean only that the speaker likes to shop on the other hand “he is addicted” might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour when people use the word about psychoactive mind-altering substances like alcohol tobacco or other drugs they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour the evidence however suggests a quite different picture while substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine for example some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies in fact substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons to feel good to feel better to improve performance for culturalspiritual reasons and to have new experiences substance use is more complicated than just “good” or “bad” its helpful to think of substance use along a continuum from beneficial use to harmful use along the middle of the continuum substance use may be both beneficial and harmful you have an enjoyable night out with friends but feel a little ill the next day at the far end of the continuum some people develop dependence—they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties problems at home or at work health problems or legal problems in general substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others—and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations the reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems for instance if a person uses a substance to have fun only occasional social use may follow but when a person uses a substance to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety then more long lasting and intense use may follow managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us the wisdom of our ancestors suggests a guiding principle—not too much not too often and only in safe contexts",
