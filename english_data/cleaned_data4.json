        "question": "escalating disagreements between mother and wife my wife and mother are having tense disagreements in the past they ve had minor differences for example my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy however it s intensified lately i think the cause is my wife talked back to her once now any little disagreement is magnified leading to major disagreements what can i do",
        "answer": "what you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead you have been triangulated by your wife and mother this is often seen in families it s seen everywhere how many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn t go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain it is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential for example i bet it s easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint i m not saying triangulation is always a bad thing sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree that s what therapists do every day sometimes just getting someone else s perspective can help you see the issue clearer however in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love if you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up even if they really don t like each other and can t get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife i heard one mother in law describe her son s wife as the gateway to her son the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren if your wife doesn t like her mother in law she can severely hamper or damage her mother in law s relationship with you and any children you two may have from your wife s viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to if you regularly praise your mom s cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike i am not saying that this is the case with your family s situation these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don t agree with them they will get upset if you don t align yourself with them against the other they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one s side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should in worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship change the dynamics before it spirals even further ",

        "question": "i m addicted to smoking how can i stop i m planning to have baby so i have to quit smoking but it s hard sometimes it s not a physical need it s mental i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",
        "answer": "hi good for you in planning ahead to do what s healthiest for your baby and yourself that s a great first step it s also good that you are able to identify that it s not always a physical need that s driving the addiction for the next steps i would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur the psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal and if you re consciously trying to quit you ll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc well if i m on a diet and i continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually i ll give in and eat it you re going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette that s normal and for the most part out of your control but you choose whether or not to continue thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought that s what you would have to work on changing when you have that initial thought acknowledge it ok i kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette i ve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they re going to do when the time comes write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it best of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit your baby ",

        "answer": "it sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now there are several things to consider before you make a decision  you mentioned that you don t want your wife and mom to know because you don t want to hurt them – why would it hurt them  is it necessary for them to know this information  what are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom  once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation  also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves  if your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel would you want to know the secrets  how has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health once you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not ",

        "question": "the underlying causes of being possessive i am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships how can i fix my underlying issues",
        "answer": "hi there it s great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive at the root of it is fear fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough all those fears can lead to low self esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don t lose them the thing is controlling other people only pushes them away vicious circle right what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking you can start with this assignment write down all the things you think about yourself positive and not so positive then rewrite those not so positive things so they are positive for example thinking something like i m too pushy can be rewritten as i m assertive and i go after what i want it can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves if you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if that s not an option for you right now there are lots of self help books and websites that are out there you ve already taken the first step so keep moving forward ",

        "answer": "you didn t say what or how many medications you ve tried certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but i haven t heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there i would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you ve suffered a severe head injury there are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects but beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you don t have to sit cross legged for hours chanting ohm to meditate it s about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head and when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus and refocus and refocus like i said it takes practice so don t give up you can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation i hope this helps and best of luck to you ",

        "answer": "it is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern you seem to have some good insight into the situation the type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers childhood trauma and or abuse or neglect or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self this is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy i recommend a book titled “boundaries where you end and i begin” by anne katherine another book that might be helpful is “codependent no more” by melody beattie in the meantime until you can work through your personal issues absolutely do not enter into another relationship take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole happy emotionally healthy person on your own needing another person to define you is problematic that s too much to expect from any individual for a relationship to be healthy and happy both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own that means having a clear sense of self knowing who you are and what you want knowing how to set healthy boundaries and knowing how to meet your own needs it is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time there will be times that they won t be able to meet your needs you have to know how to meet those yourself when you are working on becoming the best you that you can be eventually the right person will come into your life then you can choose to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you need them to complete you ",

        "question": "i have anger issues i am extremely explosive about the simplest things i easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger",
        "answer": "i suggest that you work on emotional awareness emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions in other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions for example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways if a man never learns to say “i am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood you can control yourself and not explode walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you what is the real feeling driving these outbursts maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern it might help to keep an anger journal write down everything that gets you upset that might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience ",

        "answer": "first of all exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health that s great that you have added this in your routine have you also considered altering your diet certain foods are linked with poor sleep for example alcohol caffeine nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep especially right before bed time on the other hand warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleep additionally at bed time it s important to keep your room dim cool and without distractions i e tv ipad phone stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy as far as your nightmares there could be many causes contributing to them certain foods many of the ones mentioned or medications could be the culprit doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender you may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing oftentimes depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep causing nightmares finally yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep there are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if you d rather not join a class right away best of luck to you and i sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved z s ",

        "answer": "i will admit i am confused about this question are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication most therapists won t even get involved in a custody battle they know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court of course therapists are human and can make mistakes but i find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this they are going to face criminal charges and jail time if their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child they don t have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this if you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board every therapist is licensed in their state there are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapist s licensure most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly don t accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this if this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported but don t try to ruin someone s career unless you are sure this occurred ",

        "answer": "i will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this however i highly urge you to do so because long term childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware there are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse some most also offer free counseling services in local areas that would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issue the important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you angry yes at your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you having trouble trusting of course the very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead two books that might help you are codependent no more and boundaries where you end and i begin ",

        "answer": "hi there being years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life i remember when i was and how i often felt my parents weren t listening to me it s even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through in addition to the communication problem with your parents it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety we all have stress and anxiety in our lives if we didn t none of us would be living anxiety amp stress keep us on our toes often i have to remind myself of this as well however it is how we manage stress and anxiety so it will not overcome our lives are you familiar with relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises meditation or yoga relaxation techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go such as school shopping out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity i know that sounds silly but it s true you would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold imagine being in the doctor s office and taking deep breaths this is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and or stressed take a moment to take in at least deep breaths and let them out slowly you will be surprised how well you feel afterwards meditation and yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety you will need a quiet place for your meditation you want to be “in the moment” and take in the peace and serenity all it takes is a quiet place closing your eyes and thinking of your “happy place ” some people use meditation music as well if you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for it yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice i would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before find an experienced yoga instructor to teach you the ropes and or ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students lastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating i would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person a letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end if they are open on working on this relationship maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue  i hope this was helpful for you and i wish you the best ",

        "answer": "i don t think you ve lost something i think you ve found something your breaking point and it s about time your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when it s convenient for him obviously he has his own issues but i want to address yours i agree you need to talk to someone the fact that you ve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying you re not affectionate enough etc tells me you probably have low self esteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you don t deserve any better you do you may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve and although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that he s not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children what would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way would you want your sons to treat women this way that s what you re teaching your children when they see this like i said i agree that you should talk to someone you can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he won t even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on you i understand it s not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your self esteem and self worth ",

        "answer": "anything can become an addiction eating gambling shopping sex even exercising it sounds like this has become a behavioral addiction for you a therapist can help you identify the underlying reasons and help you learn to control the urges and develop healthier coping skills people turn to an activity that makes them feel better when something is bothering them emotionally or mentally anything can become a problem if you overuse it this is why it is important to have a healthy balance of activities in your life more than one thing that you can turn to in order to help you cope addictions are formed when we turn to the same thing over and over again sex is a very powerful addiction for some people it makes us feel good we get pleasure from it i had a client that turned to eating as her “addiction ” the advice i gave her applies to your situation as well eating is something that we have to do and that an addict cannot “cold turkey” and walk away from my client could not tell when she felt the urge to eat if it was because she was hungry or because she was upset about something and was subconsciously turning to food to make her feel better her body was telling her brain that she needed to eat i asked her to first stop and think when she felt the urge to eat look at the clock and mark the time tell herself that in one hour if she was still hungry then she could eat but that she needed to find something else to occupy her mind and her time until the hour had passed she tried this for a week she said it worked she would get busy reading a book watching tv or would go for a walk around her neighborhood for exercise and these activities would take her mind off things and the hour would pass and she wouldn t even notice the time what this did for her was stop an unhealthy behavior and replace it with some healthier activities she had to learn to first recognize when she was feeling the urge and then to come up with other activities to do instead you can do this with your urges having sexual gratification as your one “go to” method to cope is causing you distress make a list of other activities that you like and that you can engage in and when you feel the sexual urge make yourself do another activity for an hour to get your mind off of it it may take a few tries to find an activity that will hold your attention a habit that has developed over time is not going to be so easy to break please go to a medical doctor and get evaluated as well they can do lab work and check your hormone levels if needed medication can help after being cleared medically counseling can help you you stated that you have a disability that makes it impossible a therapist can help you explore the feelings that you are experiencing due to the inability to have sex this is a grief loss issue in the same way that someone who had lost the ability to walk might be grieving over his mobility something that you used to be able to do now you cannot it is expected that you might have some feelings of anger or sadness about this ",

        "answer": "hi there wow this sounds like a sticky situation however i m here to help guide you through this decision first and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child it s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because “it s the right thing to do ” right well not entirely although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run if you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating when a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions amp behaviors it is unhealthy as he she will expect their own relationships to be such as a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child just remember what you do your child will model secondly do not sell yourself short from love everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with however being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need if you decide to pursue the second relationship i would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days finally i am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys this seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your child s father or not you should ask yourself if you were in love with your child s father first off if you were you would have never sought after love i hope this was helpful for you and i hope i was able to shed a different light on your situation take care of yourself ",

        "answer": "i am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles one thing i wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about in the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this i think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history for one thing it is a good idea to be checked for std s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don t like to do this gets into a gray area for some people i don t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and i certainly don t want a whole lot of details sometimes that is an image i just don t want in my head about my partner vague details are usually enough however i understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past this is a reflection on him not you this shows insecurities on his part you cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information the past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future if he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship you can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you i have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity it takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though if your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go don t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self esteem due to this type of treatment i don t see that you have done anything wrong if you aren t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go don t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you it is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be in time the right person for you will enter your life ",

        "answer": "i m sorry you are feeling uncared for i m sure there are plenty of people that care and love for you that you are not taking into consideration sometimes when we get upset we may think irrationally and see the world as all or nothing however take a deep breath relax and start focusing on the positive relationships you have with others regardless of how small or insignificant they may seem i think you will quickly realize there are people out there that care a great deal about you i also think it would help for you to surround yourself among people who you can identify with and share common interests with maybe you can attend a religious service join an interest group i e reading club sports group etc or start a group of your own most importantly you need to tap into your interests and surround yourself with things that are beneficial for your own mental and physical health from this relationships will start to immerse you may also like to talk with a therapist regarding your feelings of being unloved this is an unhealthy way to think of yourself and i think with a little help you can see that you are more than deserving of a great relationship thanks for reaching out and i wish you the best of luck moving forward ",

        "answer": "i want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it you are already on the road to a happier life with this realization a lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way until you realize there is a problem you won t start looking for a solution don t misunderstand me the abuse is not your fault you are seeing a pattern though so this does need to be addressed first go and buy the book “boundaries where you end and i begin” by anne katherine read it this book describes many situations that are similar to yours describes how a person came to be that way and how to stop it you will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them be single for a while stay single until you feel like a whole healthy happy person on your own often we get in a relationship because of a need if you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons the first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own i was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife this was a recurrent theme for her like you are saying it is for you however she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship obviously she still had not “gotten it right” because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies the difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person when she looked at him in our session and said to him “i don t need you i want you but not if you are going to continue to act like this so you leave the house and don t come back until you are ready to make some changes ” she stuck to that too he didn t leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay she had drawn a boundary and stuck to it and he left she was fully prepared to be single again they actually did end up working things out in the end you can t let someone stay and continue to treat you badly sure a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work you may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across and he may not realize how what he says does to you a therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt but you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries that means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you someone can t do that if they are too scared to be alone if they feel they need the other person in their life these patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents when someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family it is all they know even when you can say that you realize it is a problem you still don t know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome be patient with yourself and find a good therapist you can t change your partner work on you and when you begin to heal and feel healthy the right people will come into your life and stay the more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become ",

        "answer": "the best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors this is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety this takes a therapist trained in cbt there are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept a lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over this may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change such as the recent death of a loved one a lost relationship or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped in cases like this what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in one thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression other people seem to be able to handle life s ups and downs and bounce back they do this with having positive coping skills in their life learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with a lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change there are things that you can do here is a quote for you to consider “you are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made you will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes ” another quote i like is “you will find a way or you will find an excuse ” don t ever say that you have no choice everyone has a choice you might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing but you do have choices not happy in a relationship you can leave it hate your job get a new one if it matters to you you will find a way don t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better take care of yourself exercise is very important not only for your physical health but for your mental health as well eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself also find a meditation that works for you there are progressive muscle relaxation exercises visual and mental meditations and many many more start making some positive changes in your life today you can do it ",

        "answer": "do you want this therapist to have your credit card information if not then cancel the credit cards that you believe may now be accessible to this therapist therapists are expected to keep very clear boundaries between the therapy work and not have other relationships such as friend or money lender with someone who is their patient therapists are never friends with their patients letting you believe that you are the therapist s friend is a violation of professional ethics and almost definitely a violation of the consumer protection laws in your state start by dropping this person as your therapist nbsp he has broken too many ethical standards to be worthy of offering therapy think over if you d like remaining friends with this person whom you describe as lacking integrity and stealing from you <br>if you need help getting back money from him then contact the police and talk to a detective about what has happened so far nbsp the detective will advise according to the laws in your community and state whether to file a police report and what steps are necessary to utilize the court system to get back your funds if you d like doing future patients who may be treated to similar ways by this therapist a favor go online and file a complaint with the therapist s licensing board good luck ",

        "answer": "i m sorry for so much stress in your relationship life in what ways does your boyfriend express his commitment and positive feelings about you to you from what you write you feel more aggravation stress loneliness and insecurity than satisfaction by being in this relationship does he care that you don t trust him very often people stay in relationships from fear of knowing who they really are nbsp the feeling is of needing a partner in a way that is similar to how a fearful child needs staying nearby a parent my suggestion is to think over how much your sense of need for a partner may be preventing you from actually seeing the amount of love and investment in your relationship your boyfriend actually has these realizations are sometimes painful and frightening to understand especially if you grew up in a family that largely ignored or didn t adequately nurture you as a child a therapist for your self may be a good investment of time and cost in giving yourself a safe and trustworthy space to think deeply about your best interest <br>",

        "answer": "sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship nbsp there is definite value in being clear as you are about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you or not whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband love and care are not enough to make a marriage work nbsp partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other nbsp that you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband nbsp it intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you re willing to tolerate and the reason you re willing to do so from what you write you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this if your husband doesn t start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so <br><br>",

        "answer": "congratulations on leaving your marriage it is ok and natural to feel sadness loss uncertainty in direction hurt resulting from ending the marriage possibly what you consider pity is a combination of these feelings be kind and caring toward who you are since you just put yourself through a major separation and need time to clear out the old emotions that connected you to your ex there is very very little chance of him helping you since he lacks compassion and empathy more likely any help he gave would be in order to manipulate you maybe for now your server job is ok do you have more time to concentrate on taking care of your emotions you were a manager once you can be a manager again when you feel ready for doing so good luck <br>",

        "answer": "i m truly sorry to hear that your relationship is causing you such distress at this time nbsp when we are in relationships trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship nbsp often when we feel we are required to prove ourselves feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive nbsp in situations like this i often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner nbsp your fears about his response are valid as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact nbsp if you feel comfortable doing so you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them nbsp you can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses nbsp in the end these are issues that you cannot conquer for him you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust nbsp you may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to as well nbsp but in terms of your question only you can decide whether you feel you can remain in a relationship in which you defend yourself against an uncommitted offense nbsp ",

        "answer": "hi i appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation i agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children nbsp children need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they don t like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing your ex boyfriend nbsp seems more focused on his own needs in fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on parental alienation i agree this is a problem i also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy it s not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress honour this instinct you have nbsp i will suggest a few things to you first to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband if you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help he can help run interference when it comes to his daughter it will help you feel supported know that your ex s behaviours aren t happening because you did anything wrong it s the way he operates and maybe this is why you re not with him you can t change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression you re correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation keep on defining clear boundaries you might sound like a broken record you ll have to talk to my husband about that but that s okay it s okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle it s okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren t vitally important it s okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable it s okay to not engage with him more than is necessary regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you i recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states x and you are not following our agreement your daughter doesn t have to be aware i think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict a professional therapist can help you with all of this i hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself <br>",

        "answer": "hi montgomery nbsp your first sentence says it all he might be an amazing person but there s something missing for you i m curious you say this is a long distance relationship did you make a connection through social media or email first maybe a dating website i m just wondering if this is the case these modern ways of meeting people are awesome because we can be exposed to a wide variety of people who we never would meet in the grocery store or a friend s party there are complications though and one of the drawbacks is you can feel very connected to someone and care about them a great deal before you ever meet them in person then when you finally meet them and there isn t that spark of magnetic physical attraction you re in a bit of a difficult spot because you ve already established that you re drawn to each other in other ways you re already connected it can be very awkward then to say now that i meet you it doesn t feel the way it should for me in the future i suggest meeting up in person early on to answer that crucial question are we physically attracted to each other clearly this is not only important for you but it is for most of us my guess is that you feel you owe this man your affection and commitment even though you re not really all that into him lusting after other men is a sign of that because you like absolutely everything else about him but honesty is crucial here both with yourself and this man just because you don t find yourself attracted to him doesn t mean that you re a bad person or that he s not attractive someone else might drool over him and i think he deserves someone who does just that you can have both love and lust for most people only one of them isn t enough <br><br>",

        "answer": "it sounds like a tricky situation if you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him getting over him may not be possible what makes it even trickier is that his actions hugs and touching may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else or when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light if you truly want to force yourself to get over him cutting contact nbsp or setting strict boundaries may be necessary if you don t see him over time you can begin to forget about him if you set boundaries by discontinuing to allow the hugs and touches you will not feel mislead or nbsp have the idea in your mind that he is being flirtatious or interested nbsp it would be difficult to continue the relationship as is and expect your feelings nbsp to change thus being proactive by talking to him about boundaries or cutting contact with him are two things you can do that will likely help you to get over him good luck nbsp <br>",

        "question": "i lie to my mom about my relationship i use to be so happy no matter what i always was happy i got into a relationship with this guy i love him so much we re both teenagers the week after his birthday my mom made me stop talking to him it broke me he came to my house and talked to her and she let us date again but not see each other he comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that i have to lie to her",
        "answer": "<p style= margin bottom px color rgb font family open sans helvetica white space pre wrap >hi los angeles i can tell you have a moral backbone because it s hurting you to lie to your mom i always say that a little bit of guilt is healthy because it teaches us who we want to be listen to that voice you don t have to lie to your mom to get what you want <p style= margin top px margin bottom px color rgb font family open sans helvetica white space pre wrap >now you don t say how old you are so part of my answer is going to be a bit vague there s a big difference between being thirteen and your mom telling you what to do and being nineteen and your mom telling you what to do the thing is that moms and dads start out making all your decisions for you when you re small and they re supposed to very gradually give that control over to you different parents do this at different speeds but in general you have to earn that freedom and trust it s not just gonna be handed over to you nbsp <p style= margin top px margin bottom px color rgb font family open sans helvetica white space pre wrap >you might not like this part your parent has the right to make the rules my guess is there s a reason why mom is holding you back even if it doesn t make sense to you breaking her rules isn t going to get you what you want which is freedom right i guarantee you that mom wants you to eventually earn freedom but she s not supposed to give it to you until you re ready because her first job is to keep you safe <span style= line height > nbsp i like that your mom has limits for you too many parents are sort of looking the other way busy with their own thing whether you know it or not you need protection like all kids do appropriate for your age of course < span><p style= margin top px margin bottom px color rgb font family open sans helvetica white space pre wrap ><span style= line height >it sounds like what you want to say to your mom is i want to make my own decisions about who i spend time with that s a normal wish and i encourage you to say that to her depending on your age and whether you ve earned it she might listen nbsp < span><p style= margin top px margin bottom px color rgb font family open sans helvetica white space pre wrap >so you re sending her that message that you want to send but you re doing it in a sneaky way and that s not going to go well when she finds out it s called passive aggressive when you say something with a sneaky behaviour rather than with words it s not a very healthy way of sending a message because people feel disrespected nbsp <p style= margin top px margin bottom px color rgb font family open sans helvetica white space pre wrap >my guess is that your best bet is to be honest with mom stop the sneaking around and come up with a detailed plan of how you re going to earn your freedom eventually she might listen to that ",

        "answer": "i think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is what s the rush nbsp just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that there s something wrong or something to be ashamed of nbsp if anything i want to commend you on the self respect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it nbsp <br><br>one of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you they don t see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective it s important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals nbsp once you stop comparing your happiness you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down nbsp ",

        "answer": "as silly as it may sound making sure that we are getting the right amount of *restful* sleep is very important when we are feeling low nbsp the reason for this is the lack of proper sleep significantly affects our ability to problem solve and critically evaluate our situation and can lead to a domino effect in our thinking nbsp i know you feel that you may be losing your friendships but what are the facts that have led to this belief really ask yourself are they facts or are they your perspective on events nbsp in regards to your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced nbsp as opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you nbsp one of the other recommendations i would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way nbsp some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant though and i would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future nbsp ",

        "answer": "hi cerritos this is an interesting twist because it s more common for the person in your position to want to move forward and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness you are lucky to have a loving compassionate partner and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions nbsp my hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made you don t have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man you only have to have the maturity to recognise when you ve hurt someone and work hard to make it better who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made were you shamed as a child did you learn that you deserved to be punished did something bad happen that you thought was your fault is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for there is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren t entirely responsible for the bar is too high for you if i was your therapist i would work with you to find the source of the shame and address that wound nbsp if you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend your job will be to forgive yourself forgiving doesn t mean it was okay forgiving simply means that it happened that you can t erase it and that you don t want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore nbsp you have done many things here that you can feel proud of you ve come clean you ve been honest you ve taken responsibility for your actions you ve not tried to minimize what you did and you ve chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend these are all things you can use to build your sense of worth you are acting very honourably it s time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that you ve learned from them and are a better person now it s not our mistakes not our worst moments that define us it s how we handle them afterwards i wish you growth and happiness ",

        "answer": "hi winters i m so glad you wrote because i think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing you feel self loathing for both being a virgin and for being sexually active young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they re supposed to be they feel pressure to be pure and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually but you can t be both so you can t ever win if you buy into all that horse manure excuse my language nbsp this current hook up culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless the stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt and loneliness nbsp i urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings my hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you whether you turn his eye or how he treats you your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are and it is to be celebrated i love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares who you are is so very much more than your sexuality you sound like you have a lot of things going for you try to see all of those things when you think of yourself there are many more virgins out there and many are afraid like you that they don t fit in we are all different and you don t have to be anything but who you want to be who you are you don t have to have any kind of sex until you re ready and that makes you brave and smart not weird you re tall and beautiful and guys may be intimidated by that it may take time for you to meet the right guy but he s out there the question is how do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path nbsp i hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal i wish you the best ",

        "answer": "hi nashville i m glad you want this to be different it doesn t feel good to be angry all the time and it s stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships i m sure working with a therapist you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger it s likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness and what happens is this a small moment in the present touches on an old tender bruised emotion that we ve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past we develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions and anger is one way of doing that nbsp so when someone looks at you in a certain way or says something you d rather be angry than feel powerless or unimportant or whatever your kryptonite feeling is in that moment your instinct is to blame whatever happened no matter how small because that s the thing that happened just before you got mad you fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person s face or the shoe that someone left in front of the door it s that you can t stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it s on fire i suggest finding a therapist to work with you can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them <br>",

        "answer": "i m sorry you have so many arguments with your parents nbsp ideally parents are people who tolerate that their kids are people with their own unique characteristics everyone likes feeling loved by their parent nbsp do you feel loved even though you and them have clashes anger is a symptom of a problem the real question is knowing what feels like its being hurt inside of you i agree with your idea of talking with a psychologist or some other type of licensed professional therapist see if your area has a family service agency in it nbsp generally the non profit sectors offer sliding scale fees and if you qualify your cost per session would be financially comfortable for you one possibility is to tell your parents that you d like starting therapy because of feeling so much stress from the family arguing they may very well be surprised to learn of your maturity in assessing your level of stress and be willing to make a positive contribution to this by offering to authorize therapy through their health insurance nbsp they may even decide on family counseling so all of you work together to relate in more loving ways last if you aren t ready to speak with your parents about wanting counseling think about speaking to your school guidance counselor nbsp this person may have some recommendations for your specific geographic location ",

        "answer": "good for you for recognizing that a change has to be made quickly regardless of whether or not your girlfriend leaves your relationship taking control of your anger needs to happen sooner than later if left unresolved it will follow you into any relationship you have have you talked to a therapist i would suggest you take that step first a therapist will help you explore the source of your anger and teach you new adaptive nbsp ways of dealing with your anger until you re able to get some professional help i would advise that you start recognizing when your emotions are becoming escalated and take a time out before the anger turns into aggression if you feel yourself becoming heated excuse yourself from the situation go to a quiet place or on a walk and practice some deep breathing clear your mind of the problem and focus only on your breathing as you inhale slowly counting to four and exhale slowly counting to six don t get discouraged if it doesn t work right nbsp away deep breathing takes practice nbsp return to the situation or your girlfriend only once you have calmed down and are confident that you are not going to hurt anyone you might also want to ask your girlfriend to remind you to take a break when she recognizes that your emotions are escalating know that with help and support especially from a therapist the issues you have can be resolved and new ways of coping can be learned good luck <br>",

        "answer": "hi baton rouge i m glad you re reaching out the first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours i do hear you minimizing your actions you say you don t hit her enough to cause harm but you re headed in the right direction nbsp i hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm you re causing isn t just superficial bruising the effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds please seek treatment for yourself immediately you say you love your girlfriend do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partner you have dangerous habits because you don t know how to manage your own emotional pain you can unlearn this and it doesn t mean you re a bad person sometimes however the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended for both of your sakes because too much damage has been done i know you don t want to lose her but you don t own her and you don t have the right to trap her in this because you re afraid of being alone right now she needs some space to figure out what s best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants nbsp this is potentially the first step to learning real respect honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort i wish you well ",

        "question": "should my wife and i seek any kind of counseling if she is convinced our marriage is over and has turned romantic love into platonic love over the course of a few days my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues after she thought things through she came to the realization that she is no longer in love or attracted romantically to me she instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just family at that point she said our marriage was over now over the course of the last few days she has taken a friendship from a coworker she insists there is nothing more than friends but she has spent all her free time with him",
        "answer": "hi portland this must feel like your world is turned upside down for your wife to declare her confusion followed closely by resignation followed closely by a new friend i get how upsetting this is if i was your therapist i d want to explore this a good deal because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening be careful not to jump to conclusions nbsp sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time and often this is due to some perhaps unnamed unmet need in the marriage she may have been coming to this point over a period of time and has only finally said so nbsp it s also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisis she s changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it only she can help herself through this she could get the help of a therapist but it s not your place to tell her to do this nbsp or it s possible she s met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view or clarified something for her nbsp right now it s important that you respect your wife s decision to separate if she s asking for that we can t trap people in a marriage if she needs separation or distance then it s respectful to give her that that doesn t mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now i would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what you want whether it s to move on with your life or wait patiently for a period of time nbsp i can t predict what will happen here but you can find out what the best path for you is i wish you the best ",

        "answer": "hold on sanger you know i meet with a lot of people who are so sick of the crap that their ex puts them through in the divorce process that yes they wonder if it s best to go back i don t think so if your ex is using the children to manipulate or is generally controlling the separation process that s confirmation that getting out was the right decision your partner feels powerless to change the current situation of course he does because there are many things that are beyond his control his ex s behaviours for one accept the powerlessness lean into it it s okay because there are many things he does have power over and that s where he can focus nbsp he has the power to give his children a happy dad that s huge that s why he left i d guess i bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels that s his ex s voice that s what she wants him to feel to give into that is letting her win ending a marriage in order to be happy is his right he has not intentionally harmed his children hopefully he s aware that the separation has nbsp affected them and he s working to create peace and balance in their lives but he s can let go of the shame she wants him to feel it s crippling him he has the power to separate emotionally from his ex he s not doing that when he lets her words control his emotions he s still reacting to her he hasn t completely left yet a good therapist can help your partner regulate his emotions combat shame create emotional distance from his ex and erect proper boundaries he needs your support in moving forwards not going backwards i wish you the best nbsp ",

        "answer": "i ll respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving you ll end up quite seriously hurt at the very least nbsp nbsp it is fine to play in your mind with what ifs nbsp people who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositions if you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on death since you wonder about being missed if you die it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in you play around with your idea as to why you d consider how people will feel about you if you re not in their lives this may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others ",

        "answer": "hi new jersey you talk about two very big changes in your life that have happened lately the diagnosis anxiety and the moving in together that s a lot i love how you recognise that you been questioning everything i think anxiety s got its toe in the door and it s pushing you around wanting some power over you fear and anxiety try to convince us that we need protection and that it s best to either pull away or fight but letting anxiety control how you see your relationship isn t the answer here i think you know that already you must have moved in with him for a reason and it s appropriate now to simply trust that to ask him for some patience and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision you can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriend when you re in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change i suggest you use a therapist who works with cognitive behavioural therapy to learn to manage the anxiety and then the relationship will likely seem more clear ",

        "answer": "hi texas thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you what strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtful abusive controlling with you and then you ask should we call it quits we i wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours together nbsp <span style= line height >the way your husband treats you is not your fault texas your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you the problem is not your lying the problem is that you don t feel safe enough to be honest with a person you re supposed to be able to trust < span><span style= line height >there s an analogy that i sometimes use i don t know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story but it s powerful either way so i will tell it to you < span><br>if you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water the frog will jump out immediately knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot it will die if you take a frog however and put it in a pot of cold water and slowly slowly heat it to boiling the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises it s dying it has lost its strength nbsp it s called learned helplessness when your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time you get used to that and you fail to see the options that are available to you nbsp you have a toddler and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child in my experience and what research backs up is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy you are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse nbsp this is a complex picture and if you were my client i would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where you re seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions but i do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child nbsp i sincerely hope you seek professional help with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist i wish you the best <br><br>",

        "answer": "hi georgia there s a really good lesson here people tell us things and we tend to think that s the truth but it s not i ll do some translating for you  you re so ungrateful means i need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel i m a good parent  you re too young to be depressed means i don t want to deal with your mental health issues right now i ll pretend it s not happening so i don t have to face my fear and shame  it s only going to get worse just means i don t know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sake your parents are being unsupportive not because you re not suffering but because this is all they re capable of right now they are not where you will find the support you need so keep looking for it in other places it s out there if might be an aunt or a friend or a friend s aunt it might be a therapist or a bus driver or your family doctor keep looking for someone who will hear you i hope you don t ever give up <br>",

        "answer": "hi dallas nbsp while i think it s healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that your situation sounds one sided and rigid will you have a list too there are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forward does he decide when you move in and out your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you don t have a voice in this relationship do you have a voice if you are uncomfortable with the contract are you listening to your own voice if you can t hear your own voice maybe it s time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and want no relationship is all good or all bad wouldn t that make it easy relationships don t come with billboards that tell us what to do they don t come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen except that past behaviour is a good predictor you have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now except clarity and his control may be what is making things muddy for you you re too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly a therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is ",

        "answer": "your instinct to help your daughter is natural how you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem or if only you see this from observing her also her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describe if you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit her if your daughter is in your legal control then you can locate a counselor nearby discuss your situation with that person and depending on the outcome you d be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselor starting therapy without willingness to do so is risky nbsp the person may feel resentful enough to not participate nbsp and sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter or any patient s self interest and engage them in therapy family counseling regardless of your daughter s age is another way to bring your concerns to your daughter s attention in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughter s psychological problem from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter in how to handle certain situations also if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself then instead of this slower route get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town for a more immediate response <br>",

        "answer": "hi oak harbor my heart goes out to you sometimes when i m working with a client who experiences depression or anxiety i ask them for a glimpse into their worst moments in their minds what are the worst thoughts that run through your head often they struggle perhaps out of shame maybe they don t want me to know their worst thoughts but i can help them better if i do know because then we have a place to work from you are feeling hopeless and worthless and your thoughts support these intense emotions nbsp i don t know you but i strongly believe that you have someone in your life who if they heard your thoughts would say that s not true i know where her value is i believe that there are people who would see your value clearly even if in small things can you imagine those voices you mentioned god so let s invite god into the conversation what might god say to you what evidence might god who sees all have of your worth what hint might god give you about your purpose nbsp you suffer from severe anxiety and the agoraphobia works together with fear they re a tag team fear tells you perhaps that people will reject you or something equally bad and then agoraphobia steps in and traps you and uses as evidence the fact that no one seems to be reaching out to you to convince you that you have no worth do you see their plan make her scared keep her here alone convince her it s hopeless they both try to convince you that they are your only friends except they re lying to you they only want power over you you forget your worth you forget that we all have worth no one is a waste i believe all god s creatures have worth and that we re here to use our gifts to improve the world and to remind each other of our value there are people out there needing your support as much as you need theirs can you find them my guess is you ve been alone and isolated for a very long time and it s impossible for you to see your worth in this situation we need mirrors to see our worth and other people are our mirrors we see our value in their eyes nbsp do you remember the first time you questioned your worth what was happening that you blamed yourself for can you speak to that child and tell her or him that whatever s happening isn t her fault it s that child who cannot see her own worth probably because someone treated her as though she had none that s only a story though not the truth can you find another thread of a story who might tell a story of your worth oak harbor i believe that there is help closer than you think fear wants you to believe it s hopeless you reached out here can you reach out again start with just one person and that will lead you to somewhere we don t know where that somewhere is but could it be better than sitting alone you ve stopped living you can choose any moment to start nbsp i wish you peace and hope <br>",

        "answer": "hi lincoln it can be very difficult for children who have lost a parent to then see their other parent moving forward with anyone so i understand how this change is even more upsetting to you nbsp and your father and your friend have clearly established a friendship and fallen in love did you see this coming i hope they didn t hide it from you if they did maybe this is the issue it would be a legitimate one but in the end your father and your friend are adults who are free to fall in love with whomever they wish and hopefully they can count on the support of people who trust and love them could there be blessings here you haven t seen yet it seems you love this person who is like a sister could it be a good thing that her place in your life is more permanent ask yourself these questions what is the worst part of this what do i fear losing what do i fear at all what is the evidence that this will happen the answers might surprise you nbsp your children will follow your lead if you are supportive of their grandfather they will follow suit nbsp hopefully you can grieve the change know that your mother would likely want both of them to be happy and embrace the blessings that come with having this woman close to you in a new way i wish you the best <br><br><br><br>",

        "answer": "hi seattle while it s normal in many relationships for there to be a difference in sex drives i believe that your wife has a major barrier to having a healthy sexual relationship i d be curious about what it was like at the beginning for you both but these things can change sometimes people with sexual barriers are very active for a period when they re young because they re trying to prove something or overcome a fear nbsp right now you can both accept that there is a barrier and it s hers and she can explore that in a safe relationship with a therapist and perhaps a doctor it s possible she s asexual not interested in sexual activity but very interested in love or that a trauma has affected her it s for her to explore tell yourself that it s not your fault stop expecting it to change and encourage her to seek treatment with someone who specializes in sexual issues good luck ",

        "answer": "new york new york it s not your boyfriend s lying that concerns me the most it s the lies you tell yourself verbal expressions are easy but it s walking the walk that s more important in the end when someone shows you what they re capable of you can believe them he s capable of being manipulative and deceitful and he even lies as he s telling you he ll stop lying nbsp what you re doing is called denial when you see evidence of something but you choose not to believe the evidence he might love you with his heart but love in the end is a verb and is based on respectful loving behaviours nbsp my wish is that you start by believing in what you deserve nbsp ",

        "answer": "generally speaking therapists are obligated to help their clients connect with a new therapist should they require ongoing support and the therapist is no longer able to continue working with them this may simply mean that the therapist provides some names and numbers for other therapists or agencies that may be appropriate for your child nbsp if the therapist is leaving one practice for another and is able to continue seeing the client than that may be arranged and is often the most desired outcome for the sake continuity sometimes partners or employers in the original practice may expect and require clients of the practice to be transferred to another therapist within that practice instead of being taken to a new practice nbsp ",

        "answer": "hi texas oh that s a powerful idea isn t it it burrows into your head let s figure this out first has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them have they cheated before if not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence if it s a yes then it s natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that you re hiding something i need openness if they haven t cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on what is the specific thing that s triggering your fears when you have your data recorded read on the first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you ve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you re not enough to keep someone interested this is just fear people cheat for their own reasons not because we re not interesting this may be true if what you wrote down is they didn t really do anything wrong there is no evidence i m just scared and suspicious that s a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened i can trust if what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or you re having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions trust your gut but your gut isn t seeing evidence of cheating it s evidence of something ask your partner what s up with accusations or assumptions the third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw i d say when there is some evidence it s okay to present this to your partner and ask what s going on if this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don t make sense then it s okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of what s going on around you nbsp i hope that helps nbsp ",

        "answer": "anyone who wants to change their life path eventually will be successful in this nbsp how to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps most of them time consuming with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional pain the basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted to weed nbsp almost always addictions are rooted in the person having suffered feeling deeply ignored humiliated shamed invisible nothing very pleasant since a very young age usually starting around months most often addicts are sensitive people who have been emotionally overburdened by the grownups in their family with no outlet for emotional expression or nurturing the frustration goes inward until the emotional pain feels very big and without an outlet so people mask and numb by substances whether this is food chocolate work alcohol weed therapy that is humanistic based is a better fit than one which is drug oriented and diagnosis oriented if you d like getting serious about knowing who you are including any unfair treatment of you during your growing up years you can do this once you have a stronger self respect and awareness you would naturally avoid substances because they harm people nbsp harming oneself is the opposite of self respect <br>also about your diagnosis it may not be true at all nbsp the us healthcare system loves selling drugs to people and clinicians in agencies and clinics are encouraged to find something wrong with people in order to find a new customer who will take drugs see if you can find a therapist who is independent minded and therefore free to interact therapeutically with you as a human being not as a potential customer if they are able to label you as having something wrong this simply continues the long line of being shamed by others that created the addiction problem in the first place good luck ",

        "question": "i need help with my severe claustrophobia motorphobia and anxiety i ve been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now i am a young adult and right now driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety i can t ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on i have to lean the seat back a bit because the pressure on my back terrifies me i miss so many opportunities to go places with friends and family because of my fears of having a panic attack my family offers little to no support they think it s fake or all in my head it makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where i d rather never wake up anymore i am not self harming i just feel meaningless this constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life i was such a happy person i want my life back i want to travel with my friends and family again but i don t know how i ve almost given up hope on getting better and just accepting the fact that i ll live with this anxiety forever",
        "answer": "not having support from your family for such a significant problem is a problem itself how about your friends are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that you ve got this problem are any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now you ve got panic attacks from driving and being a passenger maybe being and feeling accepted while you re in this current phase of your life would help diminish the panic attacks if no support is coming to you then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others especially that they are considerate of your great need at this time its possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourself if no one wants to show they care about this situation then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyone s wish that you be better while they ignore your need for their support be realistic in what you re able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional need thinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone nbsp eventually you ll stabilize within yourself and know that all you re asking for is some support for having a tough time nbsp hopefully the others will be more responsive to you if they don t you still know that you re being reasonable for what you d like ",

        "answer": "as exasperated as you feel and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you changing this is up to him does he care that you re upset with him for drinking more than he can handle does he care about you more than drinking living with an alcoholic which is how his behavior sounds is lonely and frustrating concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking your happiness matters nbsp his ignoring of what you re talking about doesn t mean your requests are unreasonable <span style= webkit text size adjust % >be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves or not < span><br><span style= webkit text size adjust % >avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change < span><span style= webkit text size adjust % >people change only when they realize their life can improve by changing nbsp he doesn t sound like this at least now < span><br>",

        "answer": "hi michigan this is a common issue how do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you i totally get that it s hard and i believe it s worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone you can be stronger in the scarred places nbsp i would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust it is definitely possible to rebuild it because anything is possible if both people want it enough your boyfriend came clean to you this is pretty crucial he chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret you can use that as evidence in your proof that he loves me file work on that file thicken it up having a thick he does care about me and wouldn t hurt me again file will help you nbsp other things that <span style= font weight bold >he< span> can do to help you thicken that file because after all his behaviours caused this problem answer all your questions don t brush you off if you re feeling insecure treat you as though you re a priority avoid questionable contact with other women have open communication give you passwords to devices so there is transparency he can help you to understand where those behaviours came from why he cheated in the first places although people aren t always good with those why questions you can focus on telling yourself that people change that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal or at least you ve decided to give him that chance and that you want to be a trusting person if you act like a trusting person you will likely feel more like one don t go snooping don t interrogate him it s normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scared this is a start for you a good therapist can be helpful too ",

        "answer": "since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parent play in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this nbsp are you feeling alarmed or freed by throwing away things nbsp i m only suggesting these not telling you that they apply necessarily anxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives nbsp so pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years nbsp possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years relationship with either parent basically sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are once all the clutter is released ",

        "answer": "hi brookfield it can be unsettling when we feel something as fundamental as our sexual orientation shifting i like that you re honest enough with yourself to say i m struggling with this to accept that there is a question is a brave place to be and it doesn t necessarily mean you re gay unfortunately we live in a culture that wants to put people in slots male or female straight or gay we tend to not like those grey areas so much as a culture the truth is that if we grew up in a society where there wasn t this categorization if we felt free to explore and grow sexually we might be surprised at who we are attracted to you don t have to put yourself in a slot our sexual preferences are more fluid than we think and it can change over time we also live in a culture where there is prejudice against homosexuality or differentness in general the wish to not be gay can be powerful many people who are gay spend years believing they were heteroxual fighting against repressing nbsp or ignoring their gay thoughts this is needless pain if you are gay there is no shame in that and you can still have a glorious life filled with love and passion having said all that just because you have thoughts about men or get turned on by gay porm doesn t mean you re gay many heterosexual people have thoughts and fantasies about the same sex it s arousing because it s naughty we re curious about the forbidden or we re just curious becoming aroused by gay porn is normal for many heterosexual men nbsp sexual orientation isn t just about sex either a different gauge of who you are sexually can be found in your emotions towards men or women are you drawn into emotional connections with men more than women who do you feel the urge to explore and be close to exploring your sexuality through being open to different experiences can help too how does it feel to kiss a man to touch a man as compared with a woman sometimes this feels like such a big and forbidden step that it s a barrier to discovering ourselves we don t want to open that door nbsp i wish you well as you do exactly what you are supposed to be doing exploring and discovering yourself it s an exciting journey and you might want to find a trusted person to talk more about this with nbsp ",

        "answer": "hi california what you re experiencing is indeed anxiety it s very common through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety i ll get you started and it s a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well it s natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us our brains are complex wonderful things fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it but what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily we often spend too much time worrying about things that happened or might happen when these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life it becomes a problem so while fear and anxiety try to protect us they also seek power and will take any power they can get in general fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things that something is wrong with us or that something bad will happen or that something bad will happen because there s something wrong with us they will use anything they can as evidence to convince you for example that person looked at you funny you re strange looking well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that person s face and it s unlikely it had anything to do with you nbsp for you personally your thoughts are about the afterlife about living forever what does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever what would the worst part be a therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear it might be that you have no <span style= font style italic >control < span>over who you are or where you go it might be that you fear going to hell because you re <span style= font style italic >bad< span> search for that deepest fear i invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf it s a heavy glass and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it it would get in the way you d be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life that s what s happening now i suggest that the problem is not so much the thought you re having we all have random silly thoughts that usually aren t true the problem is how long you re holding it in your hand you could have that thought pick up that glass a hundred times a day and as long as you put it right back on the shelf it s not a problem the trick is to get it back on that shelf right now you re using distraction to do this you re trying to focus on other things around you but i think the glass is still in your hand it s not enough you re looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf nbsp and the key is in your thoughts once you find out what fear is trying to tell you then you can talk back to fear so as an example if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything then you can work to accept the pieces you don t have control over learn to tolerate that feeling and claim back the pieces you can control you can control the extent to which you let fear take you over nbsp with a therapist you can learn to refute fears ideas you can learn to look for concrete evidence of fear s lies and gain back control over your thoughts i wish you the best ",

        "answer": "hi boone this depends a lot on his age and the situation the younger the child is in general the more i would see this as your decision not his a child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesn t necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution nbsp some questions was the parent harmful to the child is the parent likely to be harmful to the child how likely is it to be a positive experience do you have any contact with the parent you may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen nbsp i would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind what does he want to get out of a visit with the parent is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved what does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit there are many possible goals this child might have in mind this will give you a sense of what s missing for the child what need are they trying to fill once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contact once you determine the risk of the child s need not being met then you decide whether it makes sense nbsp the older the child the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves nbsp there are other options than a face to face he can write to his mom or dad text or email nbsp it s likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved wanted worth some effort when a child is separated from a parent they tend to blame themselves whether he sees the parent or not he will need extra love attention and support than a child who has two loving present parents i wish him the best and i m grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandson you re very special ",

        "answer": "i agree you need more care and support no one deserves to feel alone or like they hate themselves we re all wonderful imperfect complicated people and we re at our best when we re all helping each other i m glad you wrote this question because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes nbsp i can tell that you re smart because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected you not being yourself and then how you felt when your grandma died nbsp when grandma died you needed and deserved extra love and support but the people around you didn t seem to give it to you maybe my hunch is that they wanted to but that they didn t know how much you needed it or what you needed exactly the older you get the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature but that s how it works nbsp when you started middle school it sounds like you changed you got more quiet right that must have felt weird to not be acting like yourself it sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn t like you fear can be silly so then fear got you to not show yourself and when we don t show ourselves people can t see who we are they don t know us as well and then they don t know what we need and they can t care for us as well either fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you it does that to a lot of us nbsp so where you re at right now is because of what fear did to you and also because when grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn t see your pain and know that you needed support nbsp there s a simple solution but you d have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say get off my back you re not helping me by telling me lies can you be brave enough to go back to your old louder self if you talk to the people closest to you tell them what you think and how you feel then they ll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve i wish you well as you try this ",

        "answer": "the fact that you are aware of the issue and what causes it is a step in the right direction nbsp you can absolutely break the cycle but it takes a lot of effort nbsp much like growing a physical muscle developing coping mechanisms must be practiced exercised in order to gain strength nbsp find healthy activities that you like to do that can help you deal with stress nbsp it appears that you are already going to the gym which is awesome you want this to be a healthy experience not one done out of guilt nbsp is it possible for you to incorporate food items that are healthy for you nbsp remember any changes you make must be practiced and developed over time nbsp you should seek professional help to assist you with getting to the root cause of your emotional connection to food nbsp normally these issues date back to childhood experiences however this is a generalization and i have little information to go on nbsp above all else be kind to yourself shame is counterproductive if you want something to grow you give it love and attention nbsp well wishes <br>",

        "answer": "i believe that for results that last the best approach is to understand why someone feels like doing a certain behavior  coping mechanisms are superficial instruction that people usually give up on when feeling extreme pressure from the problem behaviors take the slower road of understanding why you would deprive yourself of enjoying food also if you consider the binging as a mistake of some kind reflect on why doing something less than ideal deserves harsh criticism and not tolerance and acceptance that people mess up occasionally i m glad you know that there are better ways of treating yourself nbsp this is a valuable awareness of realizing you deserve patience and respect not humiliation and severe criticism when you are lost as to best ways of self care ",

        "answer": "anger is a normal emotion no different than joy elation or sadness it s not anger that gets us in trouble it s the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations there are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they don t readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations they don t take time to think out situations or to make sense of them they just impulsively respond i would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior in addition i would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed the first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing which you have now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion and communicate that you re angry remember anger is the overt expression of some other emotion i e disappointment hurt frustration etc hope this helps ",

        "answer": "mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients nbsp this is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the caller nbsp in that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you <br><br>in addition mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards nbsp for example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promise <br><br>all that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too it is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly <br><br>in the end i agree with sherry s advice if you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit <br>",

        "answer": "from what you describe about yourself i agree with you that ending your former relationship was a very wise decision the nightmares and flashbacks show that you were deeply affected emotionally and on the foundations of your basic nature the way for these to stop is by the slow process of realizing how badly injured and frightened you were of your former partner once you ve stabilized yourself by accepting the tremendous harshness that was part of the former relationship then the nightmares and flashbacks will disappear gradually usually maybe all at once there is a possibility too that your former relationship connected with being emotionally ignored abandoned treated harshly during your time of growing up years since generally people choose partners who relate similarly to the ways in which they felt treated by parents it is possible that you had been badly treated while growing up and weren t aware of this until going through this terrible relationship congratulations on ending your relationship <br>",

        "answer": "certainly counselling can help however there is a caveat namely you will need the right counsellor with the right approach this leads to two questions what are the identifiers for the right counsellor and what is the right approach  what are the identifiers for the right counsellor the right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience he or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist this person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges not as a diagnostic category he or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall the in depth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you the moment your overall life experience and their in the moment experience it goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you value you as a human being and value the connection as well it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist gets you <br> what is the right approach nbsp as carl jung stated when the doctor sits down with the patient he or she must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person the approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development attention to pre verbal imprinting development of awareness ability ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience development of a process orientation attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest increased ability to access and contain non ordinary states of consciousness attending to what is and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down anxiety is a signal that something is wrong anxiety is not the problem it is a sign that there is a problem the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and re initiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage <br>",

        "answer": "hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that this was your experience with your family i truly wish i nbsp could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately i can t do that their acceptance of you nbsp is a journey just like coming out is a journey for you sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen so here are a few things i would suggest surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are that won t take the place of your family s acceptance and i won t even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most and that is really important patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some when families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock and then sometimes even grieving they may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden these things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience if it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away i do recommend setting up nbsp some personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them the reason i feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like you re describing they may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around they may or they may not and if they don t you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are to be surrounded by folks who remind you of that nbsp if you start nbsp seeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting with nbsp counselor may be a great idea i am bias probably but i think chatting with a counselor is always a good idea nbsp hope this helps be well be you robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc <br><br>",

        "answer": "watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult on a very basic level there exists a primal need to protect them from harm the hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older at some point there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts children no longer need the basics food shelter water safety as much as when they were toddlers but rather their needs shift to wanting more support encouragement advice and room to make mistakes this is where the ability to communicate with them letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move is so important keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it <br>",

        "answer": "hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry about this life altering situation that both you and your boyfriend are going through to be sure this is a devastating and lonely road for both of you i say lonely because when things like this happen we often don t know what to say to each other and so we suffer in silence with little support here are a few thoughts that i am having and perhaps others will add things too  by the sound of your main question it seems like you have every intention to be there for your boyfriend during this difficult time i am not sure if he is willing to talk about his health situation but letting him know that you want to support him and also need his support may be helpful  if it is possible see if he would be willing to go to a counselor with you there are many things that a counselor could focus on that may help your relationship but also help you both cope with what is happening  if he refuses to seek support you may want to consider going on your own if you can t afford it sometimes hospice organizations offer support groups and other services it is very important not to neglect yourself be well <br>robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc <br><br><br>",

        "answer": "talking about it would probably be helpful if you re both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important it may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time you can adjust the timing for what works for both of you after one of you is talking perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say this can lessen confusion i know you say that she avoids it it might be a good place to start talking about it – to see what makes her avoid it it could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she can t talk to them i don t know how you typically react when you are jealous but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing that may be helpful as well ",

        "answer": "there are an infinite number of ways to look at this spirituality religion god higher power and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people my question for you is what does real actually mean to you often the concept of god has to do with what you believe in if you ask different people you ll probably get almost that many different answers consider talking with friends or family about this i would suggest though that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do you may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure the local salvation army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services there may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussion just a word of caution in my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others when initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality a second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinions as far as whether god is real or not consider trusting yourself and what you learn feel and believe as you work through this process ",

        "answer": "hello and thank you for your question this is certainly a tough spot i have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things you may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues or if you have ever heard him talk about it that may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you for example if he has been watching the news lately transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot has he had an opinion this won t tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people to tell you the truth the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you there is no right or wrong way best or worst if you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him that s perfect want to have a friend with you for support equally perfect whatever thing you need to do and of course there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so unfortunately the response from your dad can t be predicted some parents are totally cool others not so much this is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea if things get heated you have someone in your corner there are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him you can also google some stories about how others came out i refer many people to the www letsqueerthingsup com blog it is a popular blog written by a trans man that i know he writes on many topics related to trans issues hope some of these suggestions help be well be you and good luck <br>robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc <br><br><br>",

        "answer": "what you are describing is a state of abandonment like no other a direct lack of respect the challenge here is you cannot control another person no matter how hard you try the only person that you have control of is yourself so then the question that this reality poses is what are you willing to change if you love yourself and know that you have tremendous value if you can see what you bring to a relationship and that you deserve respect and love and tenderness then you will get to a point where you will settle for nothing less than that the change that might be necessary in yourself is to change the way you see yourself the way you treat yourself and what you accept your husband also needs to change and that is something only he can do for himself but reaching out to get help as well it would be helpful for you both to get help because there is damage on both parts you have much more power than you realize and talking with someone can help you to hone that power and make a difference in your own life sometimes the difference change can be walking away from a bad situation or it can simply be changing your attitude and raising the bar sometimes our loved ones come with us on the elevation and sometimes they get left behind nbsp you must do some deep introspection through therapy to get to the point where you can answer this question for yourself ",

        "answer": "something to remember about anxiety is that it s a useful and necessary response to stressors and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming anxiety is our brain s way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action nbsp some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple the first i d recommend is a calm breathing technique breathe in for seconds and then out for seconds try to repeat this for minutes another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe without judging the sensations to yourself try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad just experiencing them as intentionally as possible nbsp combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful nbsp if you feel that these techniques don t help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then i d highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional this professional can help you determine if therapy counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms ",

        "answer": "there are a lot of ways to look at this it sounds as if there is a part of you that is looking for support i wonder what it is that you feel when you re not in a relationship because of the way you asked the question i m getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships i wonder if you have close friendships that could form a network to help with this when you are not romantically involved with someone even when you are in a relationship with a romantic partner having friends is still an important element i wonder if you could also notice what changes for you inside of yourself as far as emotions when you move from not being in a relationship to being in one perhaps you could take a look at what you value about yourself in general it is natural for people to want to be in relationships with others in this case relationship has many meanings and degrees most of us enjoy sharing elements of our days thoughts feelings etc with someone else who we trust and care about – also hoping they care about us in return ",

        "answer": "it sounds like you may be asking two different questions with regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom i wonder if you would consider asking him more about this if you choose to do that i would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience this can be difficult to do at times particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion it may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like what how who where when questions that start with why can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood nbsp <span style= line height >also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly if what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing i also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation but this could be done with many different topics over time < span><br>you could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having as far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don t like and or understand what it is that he does like you could see if there is some middle ground here it depends on what you both prefer these types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples at least initially having structured conversations such as the ones i ve described briefly above can feel awkward initially but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas ",

        "answer": "it sounds as if your ex girlfriend is trying to figure out what type of relationship she is looking to have with you there are lots of levels of relationships from a basic acquaintance to a more friendly acquaintance to a friend close friend best friend early romantic partner committed romantic partner and many more if she is willing to have a conversation with you about her feelings it may be helpful to have her explain her feelings to you while listening as an investigative reporter and asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no but are what are called open ended questions which ask her to provide more information during this process it would be helpful for you to try to think of it as not being personal but just listening and trying to understand the experience from her perspective after you have done this for five minutes it s a rough estimate but basically until you can restate what she is saying and she says you have it right you can switch so she is asking you questions about how you are feeling the goal is not necessarily to change the outcome but to learn more about yourselves and each other then you may have an idea of where you stand in each other s eyes ",

        "question": "why did my sister not defend me when my ex husband said bad things about me i recently went through a divorce my ex husband called my sister saying bad things about me my sister never defended me now that i showed the truth she s shutting me up and saying she doesn t care about the fight why didn t she convey that to him from the beginning",
        "answer": "unfortunately i can t tell you what your sister was feeling or why she reacted that way i can say that divorces can be difficult or confusing for everyone involved while the divorce is most impactful for the couple going through it the divorce itself also changes extended family dynamics also a lot of people don t act the same way around extended family or other people as they do at home behind closed doors so there are times when divorce is a real shock to everyone who was not directly involved in it i wonder if you are at a place where you can shift your focus into looking at your relationship with your sister how she is treating you how you feel around her now etc i do not know how close you were before all of this and how close you feel now but perhaps if you can assess your overall relationship you could find a time when you could ask about this why she didn t convey that to him from the beginning in a way that is calm not defensive and is honestly looking for an answer from your sister not looking to defend yourself at that moment if that conversation can happen it may be quite a difficult one so it may be good to have something to think of to remind yourself that you are trying to gather information from her and him that conversation it s not about you but is about where she was coming from after you think you understand that i m saying that you understand where she s coming from not that you agree with what she s saying you could see if she s willing to listen to how you feel about it ",

        "answer": "with the way you described your anxiety it sounds like you have different types of anxiety i m not sure whether you have anxiety of public places large crowds being alone nbsp sometimes called separation anxiety or some combination thereof one thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are on a scale of to in different situations also if you know what leads up to your anxiety it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns as for forgetting things you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious when you are having anxiety certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode it s also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety one thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems just for the regular physical so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes also if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings during this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well for example in the grocery store if you are feeling anxious you could say to yourself i m anxious right now and i m okay while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other no one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it if it is difficult for you to work it out on your own which is very common consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas also consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable ",

        "answer": "it sounds like this is quite difficult it sounds as if sometimes your spouse want you to be a part of his life which could be a part of where the jealousy comes from and sometimes he doesn t talking about this would likely be a delicate conversation and from what you mention he has been diagnosed with i m wondering if he has a therapist if so do you know whether he would allow you to come to one session so you can learn more about how he feels maybe he would be to use more of it because in the contained environment of an therapy office this way at least you would know where he s coming from you could also ask whether he is able to hear what you want wish for or desire between the two of you remember just because you hear or follow what he is saying does not imply that you agree with him although that concept in itself could be a subject of discussion because not everyone is aware of it i hope that you are able to hold onto who you are and what you want throughout this ",

        "answer": "this can be really anxiety producing when you have not felt it before it may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like this allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you this gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to you i would also wonder where you have learned that there wasn t much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that you could even remind yourself okay i m here with [name of girlfriend] and this is okay when i m with her we all have different levels of defenses in situations in which different people it s common for people to see these things as black and white either totally open or very self protective in reality it s much more like a rainbow and the different shades of color that are available in the rainbow spectrum of white light it s not really just red orange yellow green blue indigo violet that we all know but an infinite spectrum of shades of colors that fade from one into the next you can change your level of defensiveness with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in the mood you are both in the subject etc there are infinite numbers of choices and you can experiment another thing that could help is to communicate about communication if one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable you could discuss that if she says certain things that make you feel really comfortable you could discuss that as well hopefully you can learn more about yourselves and each other at the same time ",

        "answer": "this has to be very difficult to endure it s pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict very often one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait one thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like i cannot talk about this now but we can talk about it in two hours my best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship either romantic or in childhood if he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it it would be good to know what that is it could even be that he s learned to handle conflict that way something else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an argument and what is not these sorts of discussions can be very difficult and you may benefit from working through them with a mental health professional who has some experience working with couples as far as what you can do now perhaps you can remind yourself that these things have worked out before that you love him and believe that he loves you or some other statements that are true for you you may also consider finding ways to soothe yourself for example you may find that you like certain outdoor activities or reading a certain type of book or something else that gives you pleasure ",

        "answer": "people do cry in therapy sometimes but it s not at all necessary to cry in order for most kinds of therapy to be helpful when you start counseling you don t yet know your counselor very well so it s normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation sometimes though there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear if you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor you might just cry in spite of your fears about it your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality so even though it s embarrassing finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it it s okay too to let your counselor know right at the beginning that you re kind of freaked out about getting too emotional in front of another person ",

        "answer": "it sounds like this would be difficult at times particularly if you feel misunderstood you may or may not know that we all have chemicals in our brain we also have different sections of our brain that become active when different things happen there is a part of our brain where a lot of our emotions originate that is also designed to protect us when we are going through things that have been physically or emotionally painful in the past and when that part of the brain is sometimes overactive perceiving threat when there is no actual threat at the time sometimes anxiety can develop this doesn t necessarily mean that everyone has an anxiety disorder but often if we are afraid of something that is not actually a legitimate concern for example most insects are not going to hurt me but i still do not like them very much we have anxiety about it the first thing i thought of when i read your question is that perhaps some part of your brain are overactive i did find an article that may be helpful to you but i just want to caution you not everything listed here applies to you also the article uses the term brain anomalies this does not mean that there is something majorly wrong with your brain while i cannot tell you exactly what is happening i m asking you not to panic over the term and to just consider that perhaps some of the chemical reactions in your brain may be a little overactive which may be able to be corrected with medication or something similar i can t tell for certain from what you posted whether or not this is what is happening but i would recommend that you either talk to your primary care physician or a therapist or psychiatrist here is the article nbsp <a href= http blogs psychcentral com addiction recovery too much empathy target= _blank >http blogs psychcentral com addiction recovery too much empathy < a>when you meet with your doctor or a therapist please try to convey how much this is affecting your life thank you so much for posting here and i wish you the best ",

        "answer": "sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can t change we know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self blame but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes if you tune into your own thoughts or your internal dialogue you ll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings so people who are holding onto embarrassment and self blame often have thoughts like how could i do that i looked so stupid now people saw things i did not want them to see if we tune in more we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible horrible and that we cannot deal with it these are self sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame self blame and embarrassment if you look at the evidence you can find more rational thoughts such as we all make mistakes people can look all different ways at different time this incident does not define me and if someone has a bad image or thought about me it is really ok people have all kinds of thoughts about other people and it does not have to be a major problem when you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones you will start to feel better more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly <br>",

        "answer": "teenagers are prone to mood swings due to developmental and hormonal changes that are rapidly and intensely occurring in your body and mind so some of this happens to many people in your stage of development you are not at all alone you ve taken the first and very important step in regulating your moods by just identifying that you are having these intense changes instead of being completely submerged in them and unaware the more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts the more you can learn to manage them your question offers several clues for strategies that you can try for example identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response such as taking a deep breath informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking ownership or personal responsibility by just thinking about it and practicing thoughts such as i am responsible for my efforts and blame is not helpful for anyone and other thoughts that you believe and can repeat related to this insight when you practice thinking more rational healthy thoughts you are actually rewiring your brain so practice is key <br><br>",

        "answer": "are you sure it is only the birth control pills which has changed your sex drive my guess would be that possibly due to the hormonal changes of the pill your own awareness and understanding of yourself in this relationship is what is actually changing birth control pills control ovulation nbsp they don t directly prevent people from all desire to express affection allow yourself some time to reflect on how you feel toward your bf nbsp it is possible the birth control pills triggered a change in your attitude toward him and maybe independent of the pill maybe you just are done with the relationship ",

        "answer": "hello while one can be sad from time to time feeling sad all the time could be a sign of depression if you feel sad on most days it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression feeling sadness is a normal response to loss whether you lose a family friend job or something you deem important in your life however feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life if it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self esteem and self worth then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family is it that you do not feel heard supported or loved is it that you feel disrespected disregarded or feel unimportant these are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression to help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process you do not have to deal with it alone dr virginia chow montreal psychologist for more information about depression please consult my website at <a href= www psychologyresource ca target= _blank >www psychologyresource ca< a>",

        "question": "why do i feel like i m always wrong in everything in my relationship my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that i m doing things she finds disrespectful even when i don t mean it like that for example she gets offended when i call someone at work sweetheart i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her she doesn t and never will say she was wrong how do i get her to understand",
        "answer": "hello that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long term based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife s side of the story i would say that you are raising different concerns nbsp <div><br>< div><div>one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified it may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook up chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities if there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying i feel you distancing from me in other words it s not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness if so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally if this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs nbsp < div><div><br>< div><div>the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean you re so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said nbsp if she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife that said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears < div><div><br>< div><div>the last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she s wrong indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong in the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy this pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory creating a vicious cycle finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of i m sorry however it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that in my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says i m sorry i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability if neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn t do it these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating nbsp < div><div><br>< div><div>for more information about

        "answer": "hello and thank you for your question nervousness when doing something new especially something sexual that can feel so personal is very common indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying something new <br>many people who engage in open polyamorous and or other type relationships will tell you that difficult feelings such as jealousy and anger do show up sometimes this doesn t prove that there is something wrong with the relationship it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one and many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work of course all relationships take work so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception <br>there could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do one reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this another reason this may be bothering you is because on some level you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages they are supposed to be monogamous heterosexual etc etc just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesn t mean that you haven t been influenced by them we all have <br>another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening perhaps there are a lot of what ifs going on in your mind when you get the empty feeling it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling <br>one thing that i do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband it may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or ground rules if you will it is important that you are both on the same page about what this is and why you are doing it <br>if you continue to struggle i suggest finding a counselor who has experience in sex and sexuality nbsp i wish you well <br>robin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc <br>",

        "answer": "hello you are asking a very good question about how to sustain a long distance relationship although maintaining a long distance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many long distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection nbsp without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship i wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him nbsp or is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future the more you focus on what if situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure nbsp however if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long distance relationship to help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment for many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and skype it s hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and it s hard to build a relationship when you don t know what s going on in your partner s life other times it is making sure they talk often to their long distance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence regular communication understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship but this is especially true for long distance ones nbsp dr virginia chowwww psychologyresource ca",

        "answer": "i agree with sherry that in a close intimate relationship you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others these questions help couples to build connection and trust it s based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support openess understanding empathy you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive how he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him if your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance if he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that if he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions <br>dr virginia chowwww psychologyresource ca",

        "answer": "you may not get her to understand your point of view with any more success than your wife is having with you to do the same it is possible you are a balanced couple in the sense of neither one of you understanding the other the deeper question to ponder is whether each of you can accept the other person even though you each have very different terms for defining cheating you will find either there are enough strong similarities to keep the two of you happy as a couple or there aren t these similarities then the new question would be whether either of you want to address your findings or not ",

        "answer": "although we can have moments when we feel alone even with the presence of family and friends feeling alone most of the time could be a sign that there is a lack of connection between you and your loved ones generally the lack of connection can occur when you don t feel heard understood or valued these are common emotional needs that result in a good and secure emotional connection that reduces feelings of loneliness nbsp you mentioned that they listen but don t understand do you communication clearly about what you need emotionally understood accepted valued heard empathized to help you ask for the right type of support you can ask yourself what it is about the situation that is bothering you and how you would wish for your friends and family to respond to you the result may be an answer that is more informative to your loved ones for example you might say thank you for listening to me when i feel alone i feel like nobody cares about me because everybody seems busy with their lives i just wanted to hear and feel that i m valued by receiving caring messages and phone calls nbsp <br>dr virginia chowwww psychologyresource ca",

        "answer": "hello and thank you for your question changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do i agree with sherry that being patient with yourself is important here are a few things i would suggest <br><br> get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors that can be changed sometimes we will set a goal like i want to be more confident but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change <br><br> if you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it so if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual <br><br> if you are going to make changes really nail down why you want to make them what is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person for example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self care knowing why you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there <br><br> once you know why you want to make these changes i strongly suggest setting small goals if you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse so make the goal small realistic and guided by the the things you want to be as a person <br><br> as sherry mentioned finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck any counselor who does work with goal setting and motivation can probably help <br><br>be well robin landwehr dbh lpcc<br>",

        "answer": "just ask him i m not sure how you saw his phone if you re in a long distance relationship because long distance means you live far apart from each other and don t get to see each other in person therefore i think we may have a different understanding of the definition of long distance relationship which makes it hard for me to adequately answer this question for you i don t know how old you are but if you re an adult after two and a half years i don t think it s unreasonable to have an open and honest talk with each other about where the relationship is going and what you both want and expect long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you don t ever see each other in person talking texting and video chatting isn t enough and the longer the physical distance remains the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness it may be time to evaluate the situation figure out when if ever the two of you will be able to be together in person and if you can and want to wait that long do you both want the same things out of life if one of you wants to take the relationship to the next level but the other doesn t then it doesn t matter if it s long distance or not if you aren t on the same page with the relationship it is going to be difficult to make it work trust is important issues with trust insecurity jealousy lying and or hiding things from each other being afraid to speak up and have an honest conversation these things can ruin relationships if not addressed i know confrontation of any sort can be hard for some people but it is necessary at times evaluate your true feelings for him are you with him for reasons other than love such as being afraid to be alone or thinking you wouldn t be able to find someone else has he ever given you reason to be suspicious of his female coworkers or friends before some people unfortunately develop a track record of indiscretions and give their significant others ample reason for distrusting them however if this is not the case you may be unfairly judging his texting through the eyes of your own insecurities nbsp it may be time for you both to take an honest assessment of your own reasons for being in the relationship figure out what you want and make a decision this may result in bringing the two of you closer and taking the relationship to the next level or it could lead to a decision to end things i know that can be difficult but you both deserve to be happy and to be allowed to make the decisions that will lead to your personal happiness ",

        "answer": "you re probably not going to like my answer your question says a lot about what you want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her sometimes what s best for a person is the hardest thing to do and may be completely opposite of what you want addictions don t happen in a vacuum if you ve had any experience with addicts at all then i m sure you ve heard the term enabler a lot of the times when people think they re helping they re actually enabling the addict to continue their self destructive behavior tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations but especially with addictions family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use drink continuing to do so or relapsing back into it you said she recently quit you said she is depressed she wants to move when a person receives counseling for addictions they are encouraged to make changes like this they need to break the habit and this means removing people from their lives at times it means moving to new locations anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed not only that but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out why they use drink in the first place and not only break the physical addiction to it but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place she may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy don t pressure her to stay let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do if she stays the decision needs to be hers and hers alone it doesn t need to be made under pressure that will only lead to resentment support her but don t try to change her or make her do anything especially for selfish reasons let her go it sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now it wouldn t be a bad idea for you to do the same ",

        "answer": "biologically fear is designed to protect us from harm fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation nbsp a phobia however is different you used the term fear rather than phobia a phobia is an irrational fear meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing if your situation is a phobia exposure therapy can help this consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges people who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead which may not always be feasible if overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life then by all means seek professional help to overcome it everyone has fears or things that make them nervous public speaking asking a person out fear of failure examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear when you can get to the root cause of the fear you can deal with that issue a lot of times it is a self esteem issue you may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out what s causing it and deal with the real issue nbsp some fears are caused by trauma someone with ptsd is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into fight or flight mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldn t notice or react to in cases like this exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse if there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear i strongly urge you to seek a therapist not just any therapist but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims ",

        "answer": "the answer would require a more in depth knowledge of you and your situation nbsp a lot of times these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way you internalize it and accept it as your reality nbsp the first step is to evaluate the people close to you especially your parents even if you are an adult think back to your childhood children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems the obvious such as being abused can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a person you may have never been physically or sexually abused but what about emotionally were you yelled at berated put down were you told you d never amount to anything were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short couldn t live up to expectations when you hear something over and over again you start to believe it maybe you weren t yelled at maybe it was the opposite studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect a chronically depressed mother for example may have seemed cold detached emotionless she may have been less likely to show interest in a child s life not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances nbsp if one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up chances are a lot of the attention went to them which could have led to your needs not being met any of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant unheard unloved or like they don t matter maybe nothing i ve described here fits your situation if you can t pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own a counselor can help i am not saying blame it on your parents or telling you there s nothing you can do to change it quite the opposite understanding why you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition figure out the why then behavior the how nbsp ",

        "answer": "i sympathize with you it is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other and can lead to discord in the relationship the good news is there are ways to deal with this you may have already answered your question there are many medications that can alter one s sex drive if your birth control pills are the cause of this talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand you may even consider alternate methods for birth control such as condoms however there are some other things to ask yourself first you used the term affection but then talked about sex they re not the same thing there are different kinds of intimacy and many different ways to show love for someone a book you might find useful is the five love languages defining what affection means to you and to him and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other may help lessen some of your anxiety over this humans are hard wired to need appropriate physical touch in fact studies have shown that newborns premies who can receive skin on skin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who don t receive this touch it s called kangaroo care nbsp children who have grown up in neglectful environments where they re not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when they re adults one question to ask yourself is were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication if so there may be other deeper issues at play here for someone who has received the wrong kind of sexual physical touch sexual abuse physical beatings it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you a therapist could help you work through this sometimes a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship once those issues are resolved the sex drive comes back examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy if you ve been arguing a lot or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed finally look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a non sexual way you may be doing things for each other that you don t even realize and noticing these will help you appreciate it more take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways some people like to give gifts do the other person s chores or do other things they think the person will appreciate if after all of this you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful it is a very common issue for a lot of couples ",

        "answer": "fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance i ll use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said i m scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps <br>c<br>",

        "answer": "i think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question nbsp i think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again nbsp once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions nbsp first if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speak and you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely do able and possible if you both put in the work nbsp but there s a greater issue here that needs to be addressed nbsp you say your relationship is good but there s been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core nbsp would you agree with that or what are your thoughts nbsp were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives nbsp if you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasn t been meeting your emotional needs nbsp for instance if you hadn t been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested nbsp this is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations nbsp in essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hard wired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal nbsp until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually nbsp this leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue what s going on and may not know how you re feeling nbsp you need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that there s an awesome book called the five love languages nbsp it s not that long and it s very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening really this is a long post i m sorry nbsp but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it nbsp so back to the second direction you can go you feel very betrayed you aren t sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this nbsp for instance if he says he is working late or if he doesn t call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again nbsp of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoia mode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be re built nbsp you need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back nbsp you can t just tell him vaguely i need to trust you again if he wants his family back and he s willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it nbsp but be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you weren t attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you weren t meeting his physical needs if he throws that out there but you weren t showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him nbsp get that book in conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if he s cheating when his behavior isn t spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache nbsp there is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place nbsp rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past nbsp i truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there nbsp if you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again ",

        "answer": "if you are a people pleaser type or a natural caretaker you can slowly lose yourself over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself nbsp if this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot nbsp maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly nbsp over time a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own nbsp you might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don t create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you nbsp if you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family it s easy to re create this in adult relationships in both scenarios if there is no awareness that this self sacrifice at the expense of others is going on your identity is shaped around being a caretaker enabler people pleaser and down the road it can lead to depression low self esteem and a confused sense of self nbsp basically you spend so much time helping other people that you don t make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment nbsp before you realize it you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who you are nbsp supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable but if you are always that person that rescues those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them nbsp in conclusion learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life nbsp it sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now nbsp take one small step at at a time nbsp identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy and limit your contact and or set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soul searching nbsp meanwhile engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with get yourself outside in the fresh air get some good sleep and eat some nourishing food <br>",

        "answer": "you can move on and not live in the past in the context of your ex relationship but that does not mean moving on from your child moving on then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your ex partner as far as is possible for the sake of your child s development generally it s good for a functional non abusive parent to spend time with his her child but only insofar as that doesn t cause your child unnecessary stress that requires the two adults to <span style= font style italic >act< span> like adults with each other for the sake of their child what s confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or worse not following through on commitments but if one person is exploiting their child to harm their ex partner then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to him her depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn when dealing with a hostile ex partner your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your ex partner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child if you cannot come to an agreement a counselor can help mediate a conversation if that s not an option then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules for which you d have to consult with an attorney <br>",

        "answer": "it is understandable that it s very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece you cannot change your mother s feelings and responsibilities which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness it must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her this type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship living situation and the feeling of being abandoned nbsp not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation nonetheless it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself nbsp it is likely that your mother s complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support in this case you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain this must be very difficult for you because i hear the stress in your voice almost everyday it s very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed i feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance when empathy and understanding is communicated recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help after sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you this means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother and or niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed this could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite you could then say to her if she complains again i cannot change the way you feel in this situation and i encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what i could do is explain what you could do to help <br>www psychologyresource ca",

        "answer": "teenage years are rough for anyone and this is a time for self discovery and experimentation having older parents can certainly pose challenges most kids feel like their parents don t understand them but yours are older than the average parents of teenagers they re from a completely different generation than you are it sounds like they love you but may not understand you the problem here is the generation age gap and there s not a whole lot you can do about that what you can do is accept the situation and perhaps look at it a little differently it seems like you re looking for affirmation from them looking for their approval and understanding it s never a good idea to look to others to define who you are or to get a self esteem boost who you are and how you feel about yourself needs to come from inside not from outside one way you can have a better relationship with your parents is to stop looking at all the things you aren t getting from them that you want and rather look at all the things you are getting from them yes this is a glass half full or half empty point of view but it works the negative will overshadow the positive if you let it start looking for the good things in your relationship with your parents and your feelings towards them will become more positive i m not sure how your friends peers made you feel like your childhood has been taken from you that s a curious statement and requires a deeper conversation to understand where that came from however i do understand feeling different and out of place especially in high school find the strength within yourself rather than looking to others in your life to make you feel better or feel like a complete person it helps to have friends and loved ones but you can never rely on them to fulfill all of your needs set some goals for your future work towards them focus on being the best you that you can be and the right people will enter your life at the right time nbsp ",

        "answer": "one of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard it is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others especially parents do not listen while your parents surely love you and want to understand you it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences they are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face i would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard nbsp talk to them during a non emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated in other words do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk let them know you have something important to get off your chest try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as you never listen you always say and stray away from placing blame instead of beginning your statements with you try using i by letting them know how their behavior effects you finally let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand i would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist teacher or school counselor if possible nbsp most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help best of luck to you ",

        "answer": "hello i commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life it sounds like you re concerned about what happens when you drink too much and i suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not i imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic you might have a problem but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict nbsp i don t have information to know if addiction or dependence or other words would best describe where you are with drinking but it sounds like it s begun to have some negatives so forgive me using words like addict dependence and so on i mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis the feedback i m writing here is very general and doesn t address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation nbsp one of the ways to think about substance mis use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance let me repeat that it is a <span style= font style italic font weight bold >disease of avoidance< span> your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you re avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings experiences and so on and of course along the way you may want to look at triggers situations biological vulnerability social pressures coping skills relapse prevention planning and so on depending on where you are in your drinking you might very well benefit from expertise and support nbsp remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us that means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax destress calm down etc also it allows feelings thoughts and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed if you were unfaithful and often angry that s your first signpost for angry drinkers it is often true that you don t drink and then get angry you drink in order to express anger nbsp i recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with who is knowledgeable about addiction wishing you the best health and wellness nbsp ",

        "answer": "hello adults who come from abusive home histories physical emotional or even psychological may take a long time to heal from that abuse we carry our past with us everywhere we go and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts this is often easier said than done but it is possible from the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed we have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting by recognizing that those who hurt us however they did might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed nbsp those who have directly hurt you may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions even in the worst of cases they themselves may be doing what they can either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before how are they behaving toward you now can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves and isn t dependent on an apology from an offender by forgiving even in the absence of any apology we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process talking with someone who can be non judgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier than trying to go it alone i would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey so that you can begin a path toward healing <br>warm regards shawn berthel m s lmhc<br><br><br>",

        "answer": "hello coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be can be emotionally disturbing and quite unsettling it creates anxiety maybe even panic and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity it becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys or if you desire them to be intimate with you it is important to know what impact this has on you because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex i am not going to pass judgment on you either way even for having the thoughts i have worked with the lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer lgbtq community in various ways over the years many i speak to say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually maybe you are bisexual and don t have an exclusive attraction to the same sex you might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area to explore the feelings and issues around this topic talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too running from your feelings is not a good idea and others in a support group for sexuality issues might be able to relate to you and what you re going through right now this will offer you perspective as you think on how this plays out in your life counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now i encourage you to consider reaching out for help you are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor nor of having feelings of same sex attraction if you decide you are indeed gay then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling there is a huge community of support for you additionally we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues a counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings and help you come to terms with them more directly i hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life no matter what do not fear being yourself again you are not alone i promise <br>warm regards shawn berthel m s lmhc",

        "answer": "first step is to remove the label of your behavior as a syndrome and instead understand the reasons for it  imposter syndrome sounds like a name someone made up to write a book and have lots of people buy it bc it gives the feeling they know themselves by calling themselves this name instead consider your own unique qualities including your fears of being recognized as adding value to people s lives if you were told growing up that you re worthless or if your chosen career goes against family advice and expectations or if you simply are a shy person then these would be the starting points to understand your reluctance to believe in yourself the more you understand yourself and trust the truths you find as to who you are the less you will feel fraudulent good luck in your career work ",

        "answer": "there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples nbsp the counselor may determine that the client s needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client s issues nbsp another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things don t seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session nbsp the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into nbsp all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor nbsp follows through nbsp ",

        "answer": "hi there nbsp there are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including but not limited to the client reaching their goals the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship nbsp the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed nbsp all of these things could happen and usually happen organically again except for the last example nbsp your question however was about the counselor ending treatment this is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve wracking nbsp it may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision as well nbsp it s important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client as well do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist have they achieved their goals or is it something else in regular open ended sessions i try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently in these check ins i use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely nbsp i also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize nbsp in goal oriented sessions i check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and i remain focused and should they wish to shift their focus that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal nbsp often especially in longer term therapeutic relationships we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal however they are apprehensive about ending therapy nbsp this is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you often having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery that said it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now as the relationship seems to be ending feels more confident in bringing these up nbsp in the case where the relationship is a toxic one terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you it s a difficult conversation but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed nbsp i hope that this brief response can assist you going forward ",

        "answer": "hello the end of the counselor client relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons among them are the client s inability to make forward progress in therapy the clinician s inability to help the client for a variety of reasons a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere in this last case a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the client s inability to pay that is traditionally seen as an unethical practice other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client which in itself should be paramount when the client and therapist decide that services are done it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client and vicariously to the clinician as well those this is perhaps not as important this transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journey rather than some abrupt departure from it an abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed in which there is a mutually known albeit perhaps approximate date of when that program will be finished in this case the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy to a place of healing growth and situational resolution i have always worked in therapy with the following slogan if you will that i learned years ago during graduate school not every therapist is good for every client and not every client is good for every therapist it is perhaps one of the most important guiding views i hold in working with clients the therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality the desire of the client to get better at living life and the therapist s desire to truly see the client heal and grow when there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring the relationship that should be established may not be able to form or if already formed may at some point be unable to move forward in these instances referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate usually this can be seen pretty quickly by either party though sometimes it is not always clear ultimately the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client which is paramount are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere if both are observant in this process they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set eventually therapy will end but hopefully based on the client s successful journey to the place where they wanted to go and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter ",

        "question": "how does someone approach a counselor how does a person start the counseling process",
        "answer": "hello counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help that said clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future what they are able to pay for out of pocket that first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture but it doesn t have to stay that way counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way the counselor you select should be compassionate caring able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth once you have found a counselor you want to work with you would then schedule an appointment to meet that first session is often very low key there might be some forms for you to complete which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you the counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement this document which may be several pages long usually outlines the counselor s credentials practice rules forms of payment office hours emergency contact details and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law among other details all of this benefits you as the client so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor in the first session it is absolutely okay to be nervous here s a really big secret which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins counselors are often as nervous if not more to meet a new client as the client is to meet their new counselor it s true we as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills while simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us what makes it even more challenging is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we re standing on a three legged stool this is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client counselors and clients are both human and we both make mistakes coming from that place of understanding might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together nbsp part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers we honestly do not plain and simple counselors come from life experiences where they might be farther down on life s road than you they hold completion of various forms of training and have advanced education yet we are in the end imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people this makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return very often we can find ourselves reflected in our clients lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life so as you begin to seek out a therapist try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment that counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy ",

        "answer": "probably a good portion of living like a recluse was necessary so you had time to rest and recuperate from so much major adjustment in your life have you told some of the people in your life about the many changes you ve been through nbsp it is possible people sense something different about you and aren t sure whether to ask or not ask questions also understand what type of qualities you d like to offer and receive in a friendship nbsp given that raising a kid who has autism takes a lot of energy and time the way you socialize will change start with one person whom you re pretty sure would welcome you and whom you would gain by bringing them into your life as a result of how this interaction goes how you decide to spend your time together what you ll discuss you will know more about yourself and what you require to feel good around other people then you can consider if you re ready to add others into your world ",

        "answer": "in my therapy practice the decision to end therapy is mutually made together with the patient otherwise the person can end up with a sense of tremendous rejection and abandonment the way you ll both know therapy is coming to a close is that the discussion will feel lighter and move easily the person s mood will be better they will smile more sit in their seat in a more relaxed way look more at ease take better care of their appearance one of the ways to end therapy is to gradually decrease the frequency of the sessions sometimes people who are in my practice start to come each three weeks then monthly then every three months this gives a sense of security friendliness and casualness to the therapy and de medicalizes it as though the person was treated for a medical symptom and the symptom stops completely one day talk therapy is about life and life problems usually end gradually i end my therapy in a way which mirrors the life process in which many interaction and situation problems show their effects gradually and show different effects over time ",

        "answer": "hello being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily we look at the world in which we live and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution or to have value and worth with the people around us and we begin to internalize those messages of self worth if that alone were not enough you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life and who you are supposed to be in the world teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself following current fashions possessing the trendy things and hanging out with the in crowd here s a secret that might help with most of those issues not much of those problems i ve just described will really matter as they might seem to right now in the real world if you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others like your peers i can assure you that being someone who is kind compassionate understanding of another person s suffering and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years when we are young we judge everything based on what our peers have what they say the way they dress who s popular who s not popular and for the most of it all of that is external so the question becomes are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside the internal stuff with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside the internal that is to say do you feel that if you had what your friends have you would be happy and less depressed depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger it is not typically a problem by itself just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold so fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes in your post you mentioned that you live with your dad are your parents divorced or separated or has your mom passed away either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression finding out when you started feeling depressed might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it which requires looking at when you last felt really happy it is also important to keep in mind that as a teenager your emotions are often being experienced very randomly and sometimes without cause it is part of your emotional development but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better without causing harm to yourself have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so do you have a friend who is your best friend someone who is there for you no matter what if not there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors they are teens like yourself but they have some insights that might be helpful its called teen line https teenlineonline org it helped me when i was in my teens and has helped lots of other teens as well you might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area if you want are in washington state and would like to connect with me directly you call link to me via my profile page or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling you might also check with your school for assistance don t be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel adults don t always have a handle on it either being a teenager carries a lot stress fear and uncertainty but you are not alone and there is help if you reach out for it i wish for you the very best and bright future nbsp ",

        "answer": "hello i have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you in other words does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it yes this could well be an expression of anxiety or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of knee jerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific or perhaps even non specific circumstances do you think it is a self soothing behavior do you feel good after you have done it the behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage so i would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor to rule out any injury if none exists this obviously doesn t excuse the behavior it just says that for the moment luck is on your side when we do any behavior of any kind it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value is the behavior helping us to solve our problem or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place in the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there but now they are intoxicated no closer to solving the issue when we deal with things like anxiety or depression we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions so the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at us sometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of self harm wouldn t you agree so i would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunity reach out if you need help there will likely be a hand there waiting for you ",

        "answer": "your situation sounds extremely frustrating you re doing the right move to state you don t want to discuss your depression with her i guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression nbsp if you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation and you would like to tell her your true reason then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time not in the middle of an argument having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept nbsp you may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this ",

        "answer": "hello it sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior nbsp it s really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on nbsp you are clearly an observant and hands on nbsp mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is ok <br>this is a tough question to answer without more information nbsp with that said i have found that under stress people regress nbsp in other words many people children and adults alike often regress and behave differently as if they were younger than their actual age when under stress nbsp therefore my first question would be has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress nbsp this could be anything from conflict at home recent changes such as moving divorce a loss of some kind switching schools or losing a friend or friends nbsp additionally sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence nbsp nbsp i would suggest that you think about what stressors changes may have occurred recently nbsp you may also want to check in with her teacher s to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughter s behavior at school i also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her nbsp something as simple as i have noticed that you aren t spending time with the friends you used to hang out with it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately nbsp am i right about that and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as did something happen with your friends that nbsp is making you not want to be with them has something been bothering you lately are you feeling upset or worried nbsp if she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say i know that sometimes when i feel stressed or worried i tend to act a little differently sometimes i withdraw from my regular group of friends or i get cranky and feel less like myself nbsp i wonder if something like that is happening with you nbsp <br>if you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and or her teachers perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might nbsp help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively the more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter including any changes or new stressors nbsp any possible patterns to this behavior if school has become more difficult socially and or academically the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her nbsp <br>good luck nbsp i believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of children s behavior nbsp i do though think that you will feel more assured about this nbsp if you can get to the bottom of what s going on nbsp <br><br>",

        "answer": "hi nbsp this is an excellent question nbsp i think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist nbsp in my work with people once we have met and i have gotten an idea of the person a concerns and the issues they want help with i spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client s current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress nbsp i would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel i am understanding them and on the right track nbsp we would then discuss the best plan to address the client s concerns nbsp usually i will suggest strategies that i think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful nbsp i always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this nbsp i tell them that i would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won t try just to avoid hurting my feelings or offending me nbsp i want to be helpful and while i have the expertise as far as typically helpful nbsp strategies i really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don t like agree with or not agree with when i share my thoughts about a treatment plan nbsp we the nbsp work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along nbsp if things aren t improving i am very happy and willing to try something new nbsp i hope this is helpful for you nbsp ",

        "answer": "hi there nbsp as someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for years i would say that crying is nothing to worry about at all almost every single person i have worked with has cried at one point or another nbsp starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist once you feel safe nbsp you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before nbsp i have seen nbsp people cry with sadness cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard nbsp i myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving nbsp nbsp i can assure you that most if not all therapists expect clients to cry nbsp and there is nothing to be embarrassed about nbsp crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down nbsp crying is nbsp often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal so to summarize don t worry at all about crying it will probably feel uncomfortable nbsp at first but i promise you you will not be judged for crying in therapy nbsp and it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and won t judge you good luck <br><br><br>",

        "answer": "the thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life children have a way of making things their fault even when they have done nothing wrong because of this when parents cut off contact the child thinks it s their fault nbsp as hard as that already is for a child it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life this makes the belief even more strong for them they start to think why does dad keep leaving what am i doing to keep making him go away i believe a child needs both parents in their life whether she used you for a child or not that child still exists and never asked for this they didn t ask to be born into drama and two parents that can t make things work nbsp you can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child if you start over far away this may mean less visits but you ll still be a part of their life just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it every child deserves that much nbsp good luck to you ",
